    "This project will discuss the impact ocean temperature fluctuation has on the severity and frequency of Atlantic-born hurricanes. The data will begin in 1851 and go until 2015, with the goal of identifying any trends or abnormalities that may occur between the two datasets. Correlation will be used to look into relationships and see how SST's may impact hurricanes. Due to the nature of hurricane structure, SST's alone are not responsible for the formation of such storms, therefore this project does not imply causation on hurricanes, meaning SST's are not the lone factor responsible for hurricane formation."
