# Data Science Tools 1 Final Project - Kristoffer Sorensen
* COMP 4447
* Fall Quarter 2021


## Topic
Atlantic Ocean Temperature Fluctuation and the impact on Hurricane Intensity and Frequency

## Datasets
Data regarding Hurricane statistics will be collected from Kaggle, and will span from 1851 to 2015. Atlantic Ocean Temperature anomalies (SST) will be collected from Met Office Hadley Centre observations, displaying deviations from 0 degrees celsius, also following the same timeframe of 1851 to 2015. 

## Methods and Libraries
The purpose of this project is to apply data cleaning techniques on historical environmental data. Several methods were used in this project, including:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy

## Goals
Within this project, we want to identify several trends that can help present the connection between SST's and Hurricane frequency. Although, changing SST's cannot solely explain an increase/decrease in Hurricane freqency or intensity, we can say it is a contributor due to the necessity of it. The end results will show several numerical plots, plotting Hurricane strengths over time along side SST anomalies from that year.
